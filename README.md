# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game

This game allows players to compete against a computer or a human opponent and features adjustable difficulty levels for the AI. The game expands the traditional rock-paper-scissors format to include two additional options: Lizard and Spock, each with unique rules for winning or losing.

It is a straightforward game:
Two participants choose one among the following weapons:
- Rock (closed fist, in red)
- Paper (open hand, in yellow)
- Scissors (scissor with two fingers, in purple)
- Lizard (puppet-like hand, in green)
- Spock (Vulcan salutation, in blue)

They show the other participant the weapon.

The winning outcome is as follows:
- Rock: Wins against Lizard or Scissors (crushes the Lizard and breaks the Scissor)
- Paper: Wins against Spock or Rock (disproves Spock and wraps the Rock)
- Scissors: Wins against Lizard and Paper (kills the Lizard or cuts the Paper)
- Lizard: Wins against Spock and Paper (poisons Spock or eats the Paper)
- Spock: Wins against Rock and Paper (vaporizes the Rock and smashes the Scissors)
